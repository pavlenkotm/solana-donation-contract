**Benefits:**
- Gamification of donations
- Recognition for major contributors
- Foundation for reward systems

### 3. **Pause/Unpause Functionality**
- Emergency stop mechanism for contract
- Admin-controlled pause state
- Prevents donations when paused
- Admin functions remain available when paused

**Benefits:**
- Security in case of discovered vulnerabilities

### 4. **Partial Withdrawal Feature**
- Flexible fund management for admins
- Withdraw specific amounts instead of all funds
- Maintains rent exemption automatically
- Prevents withdrawal of zero amounts

**Benefits:**
- Better treasury management
- Gradual fund utilization
- Improved financial planning

### 5. **Enhanced Event System**
- Added donor tier to donation events

## 🛠️ Client SDK

### DonationClient Class
Created a comprehensive TypeScript SDK with:

#### Core Methods
- `initialize()` - Initialize vault
- `donate()` - Make donations
- `withdrawAll()` - Full withdrawal
- `withdrawPartial()` - Partial withdrawal
- `pause()` / `unpause()` - Contract control
- `updateAdmin()` - Admin transfer

#### Query Methods
- `getVaultState()` - Get vault information
- `getDonorInfo()` - Get donor statistics
- `getVaultBalance()` - Get current balance
- `getVaultBalanceSOL()` - Get balance in SOL

#### Event Listeners
- `onDonation()` - Listen to donations
- `onWithdraw()` - Listen to withdrawals
- `onPause()` - Listen to pause events
- `removeEventListener()` - Cleanup

#### Helper Methods
- `getDonorInfoPDA()` - Derive donor PDA
- Automatic conversion between lamports and SOL
- Proper error handling and logging

**Benefits:**
- Easy integration for frontend developers
- Type-safe API
- Real-time event monitoring
- Clean abstraction over raw Anchor calls

## 🎨 Architecture Highlights

### State Management
```rust
VaultState
├── admin: Pubkey
├── total_donated: u64
├── donation_count: u64
├── is_paused: bool        // NEW
└── bump: u8

DonorInfo                   // NEW STRUCT
├── donor: Pubkey
├── total_donated: u64
├── donation_count: u64
├── last_donation_timestamp: i64
└── tier: DonorTier
```

### Tier System
```rust
enum DonorTier {
    Bronze,    // ≥ 0.001 SOL
    Silver,    // ≥ 0.1 SOL
    Gold,      // ≥ 1 SOL
    Platinum,  // ≥ 10 SOL
}
```

### PDA Structure
```
vault_state: ["vault_state"]
vault: ["vault"]
donor_info: ["donor_info", donor_pubkey]  // NEW
```
